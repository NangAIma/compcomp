# Compositional CompCert 

## Overview

Compositional CompCert is a respecification and proof of CompCert 2.1
(http://compcert.inria.fr/) to support compositional separate compilation.

The files are distributed as a modification of standard CompCert 2.1: The
compiler files are the same but there are two sets of proofs, one for standard
CompCert and the second for Compositional CompCert.  Both sets of proofs are
buildable.

In general, files suffixed `*_coop`, `*_eff`, or `*EFF` are the compositional
variants of the standard CompCert proofs. The compositional proofs can typically
be found in the same directory as their standard CompCert counterparts.

## Build

Compositional CompCert builds under: 

* Coq 8.4pl4 (http://coq.inria.fr/),
* Ssreflect 1.5 (http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/), and
* MathComp 1.5 (http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/). 

If you do not have Ssreflect+MathComp, you will be able to build everything but
the files in the `linking/` subdirectory (horizontal composition/proofs).

To build, clone the repository, go to the root directory, and type:

```
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make depend
  make
```

### Virtual Machine Image 

As a convenience, we've built a VirtualBox virtual machine image that comes
preinstalled with the required dependencies.

* VirtualBox is available for free here: https://www.virtualbox.org/.
* The CompComp Debian virtual machine image is here: 

  > http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/compcomp-debian.tgz.

Credentials for the virtual machine:

| User          | Password |
| ------------: | :------: |
| popl15        | popl15   |
| root          | popl15   |

When you download the virtual machine, you'll find the Compositional CompCert
`compcomp` repository precloned in directory `/home/popl15/Repos/compcomp`.

### Using Custom Ssreflect Installation

If your Ssreflect or MathComp are installed in a nonstandard place (e.g., in
your home directory rather than system-wide), edit variables `SSREFLECT` and
`MATHCOMP` in the Makefile to point to appropriate installation directories.
Otherwise, leave both `SSREFLECT` and `MATHCOMP` equal the empty string `""`.

Below is a description, with links to the HTML docs., of the main files and
their relation to the POPL results.

### cfrontend/ 

C frontend compiler phases and proofs: 

  * SimplLocals 
    - [Compiler phase](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/SimplLocals.html)
    - [Compositional correctness](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/SimplLocalsproofEFF.html)
  * Cshmgen
    - [Compiler phase](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/Cshmgen.html)
    - [Compositional correctness](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/CshmgenproofEFF.html)
  * Cminorgen 
    - [Compiler phase](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/Cminorgen.html)
    - [Compositional correctness](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/papers/compcomp/html/CminorgenproofEFF.html)

Source and target language definitions for these phases are generally suffixed
`*_eff.v` (often importing files suffixed `*_coop.v`).  The compositional
compiler correctness proofs linked above are generally suffixed `*EFF.v`, to
distinguish from the standard CompCert proofs.

Source and target language definitions for these phases are generally suffixed
`*_eff.v` (often importing files suffixed `*_coop.v`).  The compositional
compiler correctness proofs linked above are generally suffixed `*EFF.v`, to
distinguish from the standard CompCert proofs.

### scripts/

  Contains the shell scripts used to calculate the line counts in Section 6. In
  general, we calculate lines of spec. vs. proof by first classifying whole
  files as either spec. or proof, and then just use wc. The coqwc tool is an
  alternative, but it often seems to undercount proof lines and overcount
  spec. lines.

  For some specification files (e.g., `backend/RTL.v`), we do not count in our
  "new" line counts those parts of the file, such as definitions of operational
  semantics, that are duplicated in our own files (e.g., `backend/RTL_coop.v`).

  To run the script we used to generate the line counts in the paper, from 
  the root directory of the repository, do: 


  ```
  cd scripts
  ./paperLineCount.sh
  ```

  The current line counts are slightly lower than those listed in the paper. We
  added the line counts to the paper a few days before the deadline and have
  since removed some dead comments, definitions, and lemmas.
