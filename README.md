# Compositional CompCert 

## Overview

Compositional CompCert is a respecification and proof of CompCert 2.1
(http://compcert.inria.fr/) to support compositional separate compilation.

The files are distributed as a modification of standard CompCert 2.1: The
compiler files are the same but there are two sets of proofs, one for standard
CompCert and the second for Compositional CompCert.  Both sets of proofs are
buildable.

In general, files suffixed *_coop, *_eff, or *EFF are the compositional versions
of the standard CompCert proofs. The compositional proofs can typically be found
in the same directory as their standard CompCert counterparts.

## Build

Compositional CompCert builds under: 

* Coq 8.4pl4 (http://coq.inria.fr/),
* Ssreflect 1.5 (http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/), and
* MathComp 1.5 (http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/). 

If you do not have Ssreflect+MathComp, you will be able to build everything but
the files in the linking/ subdirectory (horizontal composition/proofs).

To build, unzip the .tgz file, go to the root directory, and type:

```
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make depend
  make
```

### Virtual Machine Image 

As a convenience, we've built a VirtualBox virtual machine image that 
comes preinstalled with the required dependencies. 

* VirtualBox is available for free here: https://www.virtualbox.org/.
* The CompComp Debian virtual machine image is here: 
  http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jsseven/compcomp-debian.tgz.

### Custom Ssreflect Installation

If your Ssreflect or MathComp are installed in a nonstandard place (e.g., in
your home directory rather than system-wide), edit variables SSREFLECT and
MATHCOMP in the Makefile to point to appropriate installation directories.

## Files

### cfrontend/ 

C frontend compiler phases and proofs: 

  * SimplLocals 
  * Cshmgen
  * Cminorgen 

Files suffixed *_eff.v and *_coop.v gives language definitions. Files suffixed
*EFF.v are the compositional compiler phase proofs.

### backend/ 

Backend compiler phases and proofs: 

  * Selection 
  * RTLgen 
  * Tailcall 
  * Renumbering
  * Allocation 
  * Tunneling 
  * Linearize 
  * CleanupLabels 
  * Stacking
  * Asmgen

Files suffixed *_eff.v and *_coop.v gives language definitions. Files suffixed
*EFF.v are the compositional compiler phase proofs.

### core/

  * core_semantics.v: defines interaction semantics (Section 2).

  * StructuredInjections.v: structured injections (Section 4).

  * effect_simulations.v: structured simulations (Section 4).
    Concordance: 
    - [replace_locals] is the function named "export" in the paper.
    - [replace_externs] is the function named "import" in the paper.

  * effect_simulations_trans.v: Theorem 1 (Section 5).
  
### linking/

  * compcert_linking.v: defines linking semantics (Section 3).  The linking
    semantics (\mathcal{L}) is defined twice: First as a function (to Prop), and
    then as an inductive relation. The two versions are proved to coincide.

  * linking_spec.v: states Theorem 2 (Section 5).

  * linking_proof.v: proves Theorem 2 (Section 5). 
    The two main subproofs (for the call and return cases, respectively) are:
    - linking/call_lemmas.v
    - linking/ret_lemmas.v
    The file linking/linking_inv.v states the main linking simulation invariant.

  * rc_semantics.v: defines reach-closed semantics (Section 5).

  * context_equiv.v: defines reach-closed contextual equivalence and proves
    Corollary 1 (Section 5).

### driver/

  * CompositionalCompiler.v: proves Theorem 3 (Section 6).
  * CompositionalComplements.v: proves Corollary 2 (Section 6).

### scripts/

  Contains the shell scripts used to calculate the line counts in Section 6. In
  general, we calculate lines of spec. vs. proof by first classifying whole
  files as either spec. or proof, and then just use wc. The coqwc tool is an
  alternative, but it often seems to undercount proof lines and overcount
  spec. lines.

  For some specification files (e.g., backend/RTL.v), we do not count in our
  "new" line counts those parts of the file, such as definitions of operational
  semantics, that are duplicated in our own files (e.g., backend/RTL_coop.v).

  The current line counts are slightly lower than those listed in the paper. We
  added the line counts to the paper a few days before the deadline and have
  since removed some dead comments, definitions, and lemmas.
