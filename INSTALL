                         ============

Compositional CompCert builds under Coq 8.4pl4 plus Ssreflect 1.5 and MathComp
1.5. If you do not have Ssreflect+MathComp, you will be able to build everything
but the files in the linking/ subdirectory (horizontal composition/proofs) and
driver/CompilerComplements.v, which depends on linking/.

To build just the proof, unzip the .tgz file, go to the root directory, 
and type:
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make depend
  make proof

To build the compiler, do:
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make depend
  make
