INSTALL

Compositional CompCert builds under Coq 8.4pl4 plus Ssreflect
1.5 and MathComp 1.5. If you do not have Ssreflect+MathComp,
you will be able to build everything but the files in the
linking/ subdirectory (horizontal composition/proofs) and
driver/CompilerComplements.v, which depends on linking/.

To build, unzip the .tgz file, go to the root directory,
and type:
  ./configure ia32-linux
  make depend
  make

CUSTOM SSREFLECT INSTALLATION

If your Ssreflect/MathComp are installed in a nonstandard
place (e.g., in your home directory rather than system-wide),
edit variables SSREFLECT and MATHCOMP in the Makefile to
point to appropriate installation directories.
