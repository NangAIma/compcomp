(** * Core semantics *)

(** A "core semantics" represents a fairly traditional small step
   semantics of computation.  Core semantics are designed to cooperate
   with "extensions" which give semantics to primtive constructs not
   defined by the extensible semantics (e.g., external function
   calls).

   The [G] type parameter is the type of global environments, the type
   [C] is the type of core states, and the type [E] is the type of
   extension requests.

   [at_external] gives a way to determine when the sequential
      execution is blocked on an extension call, and to extract the
      data necessary to execute the call.
   
   [after_external] give a way to inject the extension call results
      back into the sequential state so execution can continue.

   [initial_core] produces the core state corresponding to an entry
      point of a module.  The arguments are the genv, a pointer to the
      function to run, and the arguments for that function.

   [halted] indicates when a program state has reached a halted state,
      and what it's exit code/return value is when it has reached such
      a state.

   [corestep] is the fundamental small-step relation for the
      sequential semantics.

   The remaining properties give basic sanity properties which constrain
   the behavior of programs.
    1) a state cannot be both blocked on an extension call
        and also step,
    2) a state cannot both step and be halted, and
    3) a state cannot both be halted and blocked on an external call. *)

Implicit Arguments CoreSemantics [].

(** "Cooperating" semantics impose additional constraints; in
   particular, they specialize core semantics to CompCert memories and
   require that the memories produced by coresteps are "forward" w/r/t
   the initial memory. See [mem_lemmas.v] for the defn. of
   [mem_forward]. *)
